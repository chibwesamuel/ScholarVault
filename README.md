## Technologies Used

ScholarVault leverages a stack of modern technologies to deliver a robust and feature-rich inventory management solution:

### Backend Tech Stack:

- **Node.js**: I chose Node.js for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which makes it ideal for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: As a minimalist web framework for Node.js, Express.js provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications, making it a perfect choice for developing the backend of ScholarVault.
- **MongoDB**: This NoSQL database is known for its scalability and flexibility in handling diverse data types. MongoDB is well-suited for the dynamic nature of inventory data.
- **Mongoose**: I used Mongoose as an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, which simplifies data modeling and ensures data validation and business logic hooks.
- **body-parser**: This middleware is essential for parsing incoming request bodies, making it easier to handle form submissions and JSON data.
- **connect-mongo**: I chose connect-mongo to store session data in MongoDB, ensuring persistent session management across server restarts.
- **cors**: Enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is crucial for allowing the frontend to communicate with the backend securely.
- **express-session**: This middleware is used for managing user sessions, providing a secure way to handle user authentication and session persistence.
- **multer**: Multer is used for handling file uploads, a necessary feature for uploading images and documents related to inventory items.
- **nodemon**: Nodemon automatically restarts the server upon detecting changes in the source code, enhancing development efficiency.

### Frontend Tech Stack:

- **React**: I selected React for its component-based architecture, which promotes reusability and makes the development of dynamic user interfaces more efficient.
- **Redux**: Redux is used for managing the application state, ensuring a predictable state container that makes debugging and testing easier.
- **Bootstrap**: To achieve a responsive and mobile-first design, I integrated Bootstrap, which provides a comprehensive set of CSS and JavaScript tools for creating modern web applications.
